# üç∫ ChugRoulette: The Ultimate Party Decider üç∫

*Because letting humans decide who drinks next is so 2023...*

## What is this magical device, you ask?

ChugRoulette is the world's first Arduino-powered drinking game arbitrator that eliminates the age-old question: "Who's turn is it anyway?" Through the power of SCIENCE and a sprinkle of chaotic neutral energy, this device will randomly select your next victim‚Äîerr, I mean *participant*‚Äîwith absolutely zero favoritism (unless you've somehow offended the random number generator).

## Features That Will Revolutionize Your Social Life

- **Random Name Selection**: Watch in awe as the LCD display chooses your fate from a carefully curated list of 10 names. Don't like the selection? Too bad! (Just kidding, press the button again.)

- **Tilt Detection**: We've implemented NASA-grade tilt sensor technology* that knows when you're actually drinking versus just pretending. The < > brackets of shame will appear around your name when you tilt, so there's no escaping your destiny.
  
- **Slurker Counter**: Each participant gets assigned a random "Slurker Number" between 1-5, indicating how long they must chug. The countdown begins when tilting is detected, and the device will helpfully beep when you're allowed to stop. Think of it as a personal drinking coach!

- **Auditory Encouragement**: Comes complete with motivational beeping sounds that say "You can do it!" in robot language.

- **Debug Mode**: For when you're too intoxicated to figure out why the device isn't working. (Spoiler: It's probably working fine; you're just holding it upside down.)

## Technical Specifications for Nerds

- Powered by an Arduino Uno R4 (fancy!)
- LCD display for maximum public humiliation
- Tilt sensor with precision calibration (it knows when you're cheating)
- Button with debounce technology (because even drunk people deserve responsive buttons)
- Speaker for those aforementioned motivational beeps

## Assembly Required

Some assembly required. Battery not included. Sobriety definitely not included.

## Warning Labels We're Legally Required to Include

- ChugRoulette does not actually judge your drinking abilities, but your friends certainly will.
- Please drink responsibly, even when an Arduino is telling you what to do.
- Not waterproof. Please do not submerge in beer, no matter how tempting.
- Side effects may include: becoming the life of the party, newfound respect for embedded systems, and the strange desire to talk to your other electronics.
